# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms build solutions by repeatedly making the best local choice.

## When Greedy Works

- Greedy-choice property
- Optimal substructure

## Classic Examples

- Interval scheduling (choose earliest finishing)
- Activity selection
- Coin change (canonical coin systems)

## Proving Correctness

- Exchange argument
- Matroid structure
